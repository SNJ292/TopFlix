### Notes
So far, I have only encountered minor challenges that were pretty quick to fix such as making sure to not add constraints to a nearby neighbor that doesn't have any constraints on it or else it would mess up the neighbors height and width, or figuring out the constraints needed for the Launch Screen Storyboard.
