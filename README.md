### Notes
TopFlix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).
In this project, I was challenged with dealing in Collection Views since my image views we're coming out very tiny. I later found out the issue as I was scrolling through the CodePath Discussion Questions site when I saw someone else having the same problem but had it resolved from someone else's help.

### Notes
So far, I have only encountered minor challenges that were pretty quick to fix such as making sure to not add constraints to a nearby neighbor that doesn't have any constraints on it or else it would mess up the neighbors height and width, or figuring out the constraints needed for the Launch Screen Storyboard.
